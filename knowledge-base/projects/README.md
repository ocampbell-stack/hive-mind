# Projects

This section contains project-specific knowledge organized by project name.

## Structure
Each project gets a subdirectory:
```
projects/
  {project-name}/
    charter.md      - Project charter and objectives
    milestones.md   - Key dates and deliverables
    workstreams.md  - Active workstreams and owners
    decisions.md    - Key decisions and rationale
```

## Usage
Agents should consult project files when:
- Working on tasks related to a specific project
- Producing deliverables for project stakeholders
- Understanding dependencies between projects
