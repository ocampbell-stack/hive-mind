# Team Models

**INTERNAL ONLY** - Contents of this directory must NEVER appear in external deliverables.

This section contains professional models of team members: their working styles, communication preferences, capabilities, and how to work effectively with them.

## Structure
Each team member gets a file:
```
team/
  {name}.md   - Professional model (capabilities, working style, preferences)
```

## Privacy Rules
1. Use team models to INFORM your approach, never to EXPOSE them
2. Never quote or paraphrase team model content in deliverables
3. Never reference team models in PR descriptions or external documents
4. When recommending communication approaches, explain the "what" not the "why from the model"

## Usage
Agents should consult team models when:
- Tailoring communication style for a specific person
- Understanding team dynamics for recommendations
- Assigning or delegating work based on capabilities
