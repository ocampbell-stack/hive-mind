# User Profile

This section contains the user's identity, expertise, goals, and preferences for how the hive-mind should augment their work.

## Contents
- `profile.md` - Core user profile: identity, expertise, goals, working context, augmentation preferences

## Usage
Agents should consult the user profile when:
- Framing deliverables from the user's perspective
- Calibrating technical depth and communication style
- Grounding recommendations in the user's goals and role
- Understanding who the user works with and what they care about

## Getting Started
Run `/hive.onboard` to build your profile through a guided conversation, or `/hive.ingest` with notes about yourself to create it from existing context.
